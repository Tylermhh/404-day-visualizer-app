# Taskcraft by 404
A todo / task-analyzer app

## Project Vision
For STEM students who aren’t and wish to be aware of how they spend their time, the time app is a time management and visualizer app that serves as a motivating to-do list.

Unlike built-in “to-do lists” our product analyzes how long each item took you to visualize how you spent your time that day and motivates you to be more productive.

## Project Description
Taskcraft is an app design to help individuals gain a better understanding of their time spending habits. Keeping track of time can get hard, especially if you have a lot of
thing going on all at once, like having various projects or homework assignments you need to get done. The purpose of Taskcraft is to help you keep track of your time and help
you visualize how you spend it. By having various ways to keep track of how long you work on certain tasks or how often you work on one subset of tasks compared to another, 
Taskcraft provides various visualization methods, like hours spent per category, to help you gain an understanding on how you spend most of your time.
