# Taskcraft by 404
A todo/task-analyzer app

## Project Vision
For STEM students who aren’t and wish to be aware of how they spend their time, the time app is a time management and visualizer app that serves as a motivating to-do list.
Unlike built-in “to-do lists” our product analyzes how long each item took you to visualize how you spent your time that day and motivates you to be more productive.
